Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?

A programming language is a computer language. It is a set of commands, syntax to interpret into a code to the computer. Programming language uses to create a software.

What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A. JDK is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets. It  contains JRE, compiler,Interpreter and JAR etc. JRE- It is an environment that is required for executing java application. Java compiler checks the syntax error,converts source code into byte code with the help of JVM, Interpreter executes the program. JAR is an Archive of Java.

What is IDE?
A.Integrated Development Environment- It is tools which is need to write,debug and test the code,

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A.Eclipse,IntelliJ,NetBeans,JDeveloper etc

Explain the entire java life cycle.
There are 3 main stages of java life cycle...Editing the program, compiling the source code and executing the code.

what is class?
A class is blueprint of object , it is a group of objects which has common properties.

What is object?
 Object is an instance of a class. Suppose Bicycle is a class then MountainBicyle,SportsBicycle can be considered as objects of the class.

What is the entry point of an application?
Main() method  is the entry point. It is the first method that is invoked when Java program runs.

Why main is static?
The main purpose of using the static keyword in Java is to save memory.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
Object is the Super class all all classes.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
The path defines where the system can find the executable files. Classpath environment variable uses to specify the location of the classes and packages.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
An Interface only allows defining functionality,not implementing it.  Abstract class  allows to create functionality Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods..Interface can have only abstract methods. Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance. Interface supports multiple inheritance.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
It creates an object of the proxy class which implements that interface. Abstract class and interface can not be instantiated.

what is Access Specifier?
An access specifier is a defining code element that can determine which elements of a program are allowed to access a specific variable  or other piece of data.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
Object Oriented Programming combine data and action together and to reuse the codes as and when required.
OOP features are ..object,class,inheritance,polymorphism,abstruction and encapsulation.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
Packages are a folder in java that wraps a group of classes, sub-packages and different interfaces. The default package is a collection of java classes whose source files do not contain and paca=kage declarations. These packages act as the default package for such classes.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
An  application programming interface is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. Gmail, google maps,Netflix,Zoom
Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
Java does not support multiple inheritances in classes. To prevent ambiguity.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
Overloading is writing the same method with different parameters.Overloading method can have different return types. Overloading happens at compile time.
Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
In Java programming when an issue can be fixed it called execeptions method like open a file, User Input, Dividing by 0. Exception can be handled by checked and unchecked.
What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A final variable is considered read only. Once defined and initialized, it canâ€™t be modified.
to use final variables using uppercase letters and underscores as separator.
What is final, finally and finalize?
The final keyword is a non access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods. Finally defines a block of code to run when the try, except that means it can be useful to close objects and clean up resources,
Finalize is a method of the Object class that is used to perform clean up activity before destroying any objects.
What is a constructor ?
A constructor in java is similar that is invoked when an object of the class is created.
Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
Yes we can have many constructors in a class that differ in the number or type of the parameter.
If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A default constructor is created only when there is no declared any constructor in the code.
What is "this" keyword in java ?
"This" keyword in Java is a reference variable that refers to the current object of a method or a constructor.
What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
The super keyword in java is a reference variable that is used to refer to parent class objects.
What is JVM stand for?
Java virtual machine.
Is JVM platform independent?
Yes, it is platform independent.
What version of java are you using?
version 11.0
What is JAR stand for ?
Java ARchive
What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
JDK is a software development kit that helps in the development of application in Java which provides Java class libraries with necessary components to run java code
JVM executes Java byte code and provides an environment for execute.
What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
JRE provides the minimum requirements for executing a java application and JVM is a java virtual machine.
What is compile time and run time?
Compile time is the period when the programming code is converted to the machine code and Run time is the period of time when a program is running.
What is heap?
The heap is a special data structure in Java.
How java manage it's memory?
Java manage the memory through garbage collection and it is an automatic memory.
What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
String is immutable, StringBuilder is mutable,and String Buffer is thread safe while StringBuilder does not
guarantee thread safe.String Buffer makes control of one thread access at a time while it is not seen in StringBuilder, thread unsafe.

A String is a sequence of characters.
What is Singleton class?
Singleton class is a class that can have only one object at a time.
What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Java serialization means converting java objects into a byte stream, Deserialization means converting the serialized objects byte stream back to the original java object.
when to use transient variable in java?
Transient variable modifier used in serialization.
Difference between while and do..while loop?
A while loop and do while loop is that while loop check condition before iteration of the loop.Dowhile loop - body first
then checks for a condition and While loop- checks for condition first then run the loop body.
What is Enum?
An enum type is a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set of predefined constants.
What is Iterator?
Iterators in java are used in the collection framework to retrieve elements one by one.
Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
Int takes 32 bit and Integer which takes 128 bits.
Why is String Immutable in Java?
The String is immutable, value cannot be changed.
What is constructor chaining in Java?
Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.
The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
What is JIT stands for?
Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
what is multithreading in java?
What is the use of synchronization in Java?
What is Framework?
